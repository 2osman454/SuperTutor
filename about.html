    <p id="parAroundProfile">A proud <a href="https://issuu.com/uofguelph/docs/classof2020_uofguelph_convocation_program" 
      target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">graduate</a> with a BSCH degree in Biochemistry and Mathematical 
      Science from the <a href="https://www.uoguelph.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Guelph</a>, 
      I am a competent tutor with experience in tutoring high 
      school Mathematics, Chemistry, and Physics.
    </p>
    <h4>Secondary School and Kakuma Refugee Camp</h4>
    <p>My love for teaching started back in high school (secondary school, Kenya) at Kakuma Refugee Secondary School 
      (KRSS) and Pleasant View Secondary School (now Pleasant View Schools). 
      After graduating from KRSS as the third-best overall performer in Turkana West county for the 2013 Kenya 
      Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) exams, I was employed as an incentive teacher by the
      <a href="https://kenyasomalia.lutheranworld.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lutheran World 
        Federation </a> (LWF) in January 2014 and by <a href="https://windle.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener 
        noreferrer">Windle Trust Kenya</a> (WTK) the following year. 
    </p>
    <h4>Incentive Teacger</h4>
    <p>Wondering what an incentive teacher is? The best explanation I can find is from the 
      <a href="https://inee.org/eie-glossary/incentive-teacher" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inter-agency 
        Network for Education in Emergencies</a>
     (INEE): “The term incentive worker refers to a refugee who works 
      for a UN or NGO agency in exchange for monthly incentive payments (stipend), which are usually substantially 
      lower than the monthly wages (salary) of non-refugee staff.” </p>
      <p> How low, you asked? Well, for primary and Secondary 
      School incentive teachers at the time and up to now, the MONTHLY PAYMENT is around KSH 6000 (about CAD 75) and 
      KSH 7200 (about CAD 85), respectively. That is one of the many issues that 
      <a href="https://kanere.org/incentive-pay-raises-and-terminations-targeting-incentive-staffs/" target="_blank" 
      rel="noopener noreferrer">Kakuma News Reflector</a> (KANERE) report.</p>
    <p>Like other colleagues of mine who got the same incentive teaching positions, it was at KRSS that I earned 
      the title of “Mwalimu,” a Kiswahili word for “the teacher.” At KRSS, I taught Chemistry, Mathematics, and 
      Physics. As you may have guessed, the payment was not really the driving force. My reward and source of motivation 
      was the compliment and results from my students (some of them with me in Canada now). That meant and still means a 
      lot to me.
    </p>
    <h4>The University of Guelph and Canada</h4>
    <p>Fast forward. In 2015, I was fortunate enough to be among the students sponsored by the 
      <a href="https://wusc.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">World University Service of Canada</a> 
      (WUSC) to study at the University of Guelph. The <a href="https://srp.wusc.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener 
      noreferrer">Student Refugee Program</a> (SRP), through WUSC, combines resettlement with opportunities for higher 
      education and supports over 150 refugee students annually. Visit the <a href="https://wusc.ca/" target="_blank" 
      rel="noopener noreferrer">WUSC website</a> to volunteer your time or donate.
    </p>
    <p>During my undergraduate studies at the University of Guelph, I enjoyed explaining scientific concepts to my 
      classmates and group members during group discussions. It is the same passion for helping others that 
      still keeps me moving and even so are the rewarding results of the beneficiaries of my service. Check out my 
      <a href="https://www.superprof.ca/graduate-with-bsch-degree-biochemistry-and-mathematical-science-from-the-university-guelph-ikebek-experienced.html" 
      target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reviews and recommendations</a>!
    </p>
    <h4>Now and the Future</h4>
    <p>So, how did it end? Here is what I can tell you. Once upon a time, I was a refugee with an unpredictable 
      future but now I am a Canadian citizen enjoying the 
      <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/services/how-rights-protected/guide-canadian-charter-rights-freedoms.html" 
      target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rights and freedoms</a> of a hospitable country, Canada. 
      With a Bachelor of Science honours degree from the University of Guelph under my belt, I have a long way 
      to go. Life is tough but no situation is permanent. With hard work and focus, there is always a glimmer of 
      light at the end of the tunnel.

  <h2>Why Tutoring?</h2>
  <p>Tutoring is a hobby I developed while interacting with classmates and friends in school.
    The more I explained concepts to classmates and group members, the better I
    understood the topic, and the more confidence I gained.
  </p>
  <p>As I kept teaching friends during my later years in high school and my entire
    university life, I learned that any student is capable of solving any given
    problem but needs a little bit of help to do so given not only the limited
    interaction with teachers and professors but also the
    <a href="https://www.pathwaystoeducation.ca/the-impacts-of-socioeconomic-status-and-educational-attainment-on-youth-success/"
       target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">socioeconomic barriers</a>
    that impact the student's progress.
