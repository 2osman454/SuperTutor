          target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bachelor of Science Honours</a> (BSCH) degree in Biochemistry and Mathematical 
          Science from the <a href="https://www.uoguelph.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Guelph</a>, I am an 
          aspiring researcher with research interests in structural biology and bioinformatics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apart from family and schoolwork, I spend most of my free time tutoring high school students in Mathematics, Chemistry, and Physics.
        </p>
        <p>Here, an overview of how I started and where I am heading is presented to you.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h3>Secondary School and Kakuma Refugee Camp</h3>
        <p>My love for teaching started back in high school (secondary school, Kenya) at Kakuma Refugee Secondary School
          (KRSS) and Pleasant View Secondary School (now Pleasant View Schools).
          After graduating from KRSS as the third-best overall performer in Turkana West District of Turkana County for the 2013 Kenya
          Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) exams, I was employed as an incentive teacher by the
          <a href="https://kenyasomalia.lutheranworld.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lutheran World
            Federation </a> (LWF) in January 2014 and by <a href="https://windle.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener
              noreferrer">Windle Trust Kenya</a> (WTK) the following year.

        <h3>Incentive Teacher</h3>
        <p>Wondering what an incentive teacher is? The best explanation I can find is from the
          <a href="https://inee.org/eie-glossary/incentive-teacher" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inter-agency
            Network for Education in Emergencies</a>
          (INEE): “The term incentive worker refers to a refugee who works
          for a UN or NGO agency in exchange for monthly incentive payments (stipend), which are usually substantially
          lower than the monthly wages (salary) of non-refugee staff.” </p>
        <p> How low, you asked? Well, for primary and Secondary
          School incentive teachers at the time and up to now, the MONTHLY PAYMENT is around KSH 6000 (about CAD 75) and
          KSH 7200 (about CAD 85), respectively. That is one of the many issues that
          <a href="https://kanere.org/incentive-pay-raises-and-terminations-targeting-incentive-staffs/" target="_blank"
             rel="noopener noreferrer">Kakuma News Reflector</a> (KANERE) report.</p>
        <p>Like other colleagues of mine who got the same incentive teaching positions, it was at KRSS that I earned
          the title of “Mwalimu,” a Kiswahili word for “the teacher.” At KRSS, I taught Chemistry, Mathematics, and
          Physics. As you may have guessed, the payment was not really the driving force. My reward and source of motivation
          was the compliment and results from my students (some of them with me in Canada now). That meant and still means a
          lot to me.

        <p>Fast forward. In 2015, I was fortunate enough to be among the students sponsored by the

          (WUSC) to study at the University of Guelph. The <a href="https://srp.wusc.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener

        </p>
        <p>During my undergraduate studies at the University of Guelph, I enjoyed explaining scientific concepts to my
          classmates and group members during group discussions. It is the same passion for helping others that
          still keeps me moving and even so are the rewarding results of the beneficiaries of my service. Check out my

        <h3>Now and the Future</h3>
        <p>So, how did it end? Here is what I can tell you. Once upon a time, I was a refugee with an unpredictable
          future but now I am a Canadian citizen enjoying the
          <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/services/how-rights-protected/guide-canadian-charter-rights-freedoms.html"

          With a Bachelor of Science honours degree from the University of Guelph under my belt, I have a long way
          to go. Life is tough but no situation is permanent. With hard work and focus, there is always a glimmer of
          light at the end of the tunnel.
