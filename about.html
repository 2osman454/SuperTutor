        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>As a proud graduate with a <a href="https://www.uoguelph.ca/registrar/calendars/undergraduate/2015-2016/c10/c10bsc-bioc.shtml"
          target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bachelor of Science Honours</a> (BSCH) degree in Biochemistry and Mathematical

        </p>
        <p>
          Apart from family and schoolwork, I spend most of my free time tutoring high school students in Mathematics, Chemistry, and Physics.
        </p>
        <p>Presented here is a snapshot of the development of my personal and professional competence, and why tutoring is important for any student.</p>

        <h3>Secondary School and <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/ke/kakuma-refugee-camp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kakuma Refugee Camp</a></h3>
        <p>While spending most primary (elementary) and junior high school time as a shy kid, my interaction with 
          classmates started in my senior high school years at Kakuma Refugee Secondary School (KRSS) and Pleasant 
          View Secondary School (now Pleasant View Schools), Kenya.
        </p>
        <p>After emerging as the third-best overall performer in KRSS and Turkana West District of Turkana County 
          for the 2013 Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) exams, I was employed as an incentive teacher 
          by the <a href="https://kenyasomalia.lutheranworld.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            Lutheran World Federation </a> (LWF) in January 2014 and by<a href="https://windle.org/" target="_blank" 
            rel="noopener noreferrer">Windle Trust Kenya</a> (WTK) the following year.

        <h3>Incentive Teacher</h3>
        <p>Like other <a href="https://inee.org/eie-glossary/incentive-teacher" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">incentive workers</a> 
          who got similar incentive teaching positions, it was at KRSS that I earned the title of “Mwalimu,” a Swahili word for “teacher”. 
        </p>
        <p> As an incentive teacher in Kakuma Refugee Camp, I was more than happy to receive a monthly stipend of KSH7200 (about CAD80), 
          one of the world's lowest wages as reported previously by <a href="https://kanere.org/incentive-pay-raises-and-terminations-targeting-incentive-staffs/" target="_blank" 
          rel="noopener noreferrer">Kakuma News Reflector</a> (KANERE)
        </p>
        <p>At KRSS, I taught Chemistry, Mathematics, and Physics. The development of my personal and professional competence began at KRSS. 
          The more I explained the concepts, the better I understood the topics and gained more confidence.</p> 
        <p>My reward and source of motivation was not the monthly stipend but the compliment and results from my 
          students. That meant and still means a lot to me.</p>

        <h3>The University of Guelph and Canada</h3>
        <p>In 2015, I was fortunate enough to be among a group of students sponsored by the
          <a href="https://wusc.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">World University Service of Canada</a>
          (WUSC) to study at the University of Guelph. The <a href="https://srp.wusc.ca/" target="_blank" 
          rel="noopener noreferrer">Student Refugee Program</a> (SRP), through WUSC, combines resettlement with opportunities for higher
          education and supports over 150 refugee students annually. Visit the <a href="https://wusc.ca/" target="_blank" 
          rel="noopener noreferrer">WUSC website</a> to <a href="https://wusc.ca/volunteer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">volunter</a> your time or 
          <a href="https://wusc.ca/donate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">donate</a>.
        </p>
        <p>During my undergraduate studies at the University of Guelph, I enjoyed explaining scientific concepts to my
          classmates and group members during group discussions. Consequently, the appreciation and compliments I received
          still keeps me moving and even so are the rewarding results of the beneficiaries of my service. Check out my

        <h3>Why Tutoring is Important</h3>
        <p>From personal experience, a classroom is one of the busiest places and not all students can thrive well in such an environment as many become 
          distracted and lose their focus on the class exercise and homework. Every student in a given classroom learns differently and there is almost 
          no access to individualized instruction.</p>
        <p>It is always challenging for teachers and instructors to ensure that all students receive quality instruction no matter 
          how hard they try to utilize the <a href="https://www.cast.org/impact/universal-design-for-learning-udl"
          target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Universal Design for Learning</a> (UDL) approach. Basically, the aim of UDL is 
          to provide equity and access to all students and to ensure that every student’s goals and objectives are addressed.
        </p>
        <p>As I kept teaching at KRSS and later help my friends and classmates during my undergraduate studies, I learned that any student 
          is capable of solving any given problem but needs help to do so given not only the limited interaction with teachers and professors, 
          large class sizes and multiple distractions, but also the
          <a href="https://www.pathwaystoeducation.ca/the-impacts-of-socioeconomic-status-and-educational-attainment-on-youth-success/"
             target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">socioeconomic barriers</a> that impact the student's progress.
        </p>
        <p>Students can benefit from one-on-one interaction as tutoring removes these barriers and fills the gaps left by the fast-paced learning 
          environment. Do not hesitate to contact me for a FREE consultation.</p>

  <h4>Secondary School and Kakuma Refugee Camp</h4>
  <p>My love for teaching started back in high school (secondary school, Kenya) at Kakuma Refugee Secondary School
    (KRSS) and Pleasant View Secondary School (now Pleasant View Schools).
    After graduating from KRSS as the third-best overall performer in Turkana West District of Turkana County for the 2013 Kenya
    Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) exams, I was employed as an incentive teacher by the
    <a href="https://kenyasomalia.lutheranworld.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lutheran World
      Federation </a> (LWF) in January 2014 and by <a href="https://windle.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener
        noreferrer">Windle Trust Kenya</a> (WTK) the following year.
  </p>
  <h4>Incentive Teacher</h4>
  <p>Wondering what an incentive teacher is? The best explanation I can find is from the
    <a href="https://inee.org/eie-glossary/incentive-teacher" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inter-agency
      Network for Education in Emergencies</a>
    (INEE): “The term incentive worker refers to a refugee who works
    for a UN or NGO agency in exchange for monthly incentive payments (stipend), which are usually substantially
    lower than the monthly wages (salary) of non-refugee staff.” </p>
  <p> How low, you asked? Well, for primary and Secondary
    School incentive teachers at the time and up to now, the MONTHLY PAYMENT is around KSH 6000 (about CAD 75) and
    KSH 7200 (about CAD 85), respectively. That is one of the many issues that
    <a href="https://kanere.org/incentive-pay-raises-and-terminations-targeting-incentive-staffs/" target="_blank"
       rel="noopener noreferrer">Kakuma News Reflector</a> (KANERE) report.</p>
  <p>Like other colleagues of mine who got the same incentive teaching positions, it was at KRSS that I earned
    the title of “Mwalimu,” a Kiswahili word for “the teacher.” At KRSS, I taught Chemistry, Mathematics, and
    Physics. As you may have guessed, the payment was not really the driving force. My reward and source of motivation
    was the compliment and results from my students (some of them with me in Canada now). That meant and still means a
    lot to me.
  </p>
  <h4>The University of Guelph and Canada</h4>
  <p>Fast forward. In 2015, I was fortunate enough to be among the students sponsored by the
    <a href="https://wusc.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">World University Service of Canada</a>
    (WUSC) to study at the University of Guelph. The <a href="https://srp.wusc.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener
      noreferrer">Student Refugee Program</a> (SRP), through WUSC, combines resettlement with opportunities for higher
    education and supports over 150 refugee students annually. Visit the <a href="https://wusc.ca/" target="_blank"
                                                                            rel="noopener noreferrer">WUSC website</a> to volunteer your time or donate.
  </p>
  <p>During my undergraduate studies at the University of Guelph, I enjoyed explaining scientific concepts to my
    classmates and group members during group discussions. It is the same passion for helping others that
    still keeps me moving and even so are the rewarding results of the beneficiaries of my service. Check out my
    <a href="https://www.superprof.ca/graduate-with-bsch-degree-biochemistry-and-mathematical-science-from-the-university-guelph-ikebek-experienced.html"
       target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reviews and recommendations</a>!
  </p>
  <h4>Now and the Future</h4>
  <p>So, how did it end? Here is what I can tell you. Once upon a time, I was a refugee with an unpredictable
    future but now I am a Canadian citizen enjoying the
    <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/services/how-rights-protected/guide-canadian-charter-rights-freedoms.html"
       target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rights and freedoms</a> of a hospitable country, Canada.
    With a Bachelor of Science honours degree from the University of Guelph under my belt, I have a long way
    to go. Life is tough but no situation is permanent. With hard work and focus, there is always a glimmer of
    light at the end of the tunnel.
